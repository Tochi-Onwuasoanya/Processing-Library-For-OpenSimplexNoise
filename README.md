# Processing-Library-For-OpenSimplexNoise
This repo is a processing library for open simplex noise. 

It also serves as a work-in progress library for additional noise algorithims in Processing.

There are currently implementations for:

[x] Open Simplex noise

[ ] Feel free to add your own noise algorithim here!
